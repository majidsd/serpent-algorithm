        Encrypts or decrypts one block of data using the Serpent cipher and
        optionally showing you what's going on inside at the various stages of
        the computation.
        SYNTAX: serpref mode [options]
        MODE is one of the following:
        -e -> encrypt
        -d -> decrypt
        -h -> help (the text you're reading right now)
        OPTIONS are:
        -p plainText  -> The 128-bit value to be encrypted. Required in mode -e,
                        ignored otherwise. Short texts are zeropadded.
        -c cipherText -> The 128-bit value to be decrypted. Required in mode -d,
                        ignored otherwise. Short texts are zeropadded.
        -k key        -> The value of the key (allowed lengths are from 64 to
                        256 bits, but must be a multiple of 32 bits). Keys
                        shorter than 256 bits are internally transformed into
                        the equivalent long keys (NOT the same as zeropadding!).
                        Required for -e and -d.
        -t tagName    -> Turn on the observer tag with that name. This means that
                        any observer messages associated with this tag will
                        now be displayed. This option may be specified several
                        times to add multiple tags.
                        The special tag ALL turns on all the messages.
        -b            -> Use the bitslice version instead of the traditional
                        version, which is otherwise used by default. Optional.
        TAGS:
        These are the tags of the quantities you can currently observe with
        -t. Names are modelled on the paper's notation.
            For the non-bitslice: BHati xored SHati BHatiPlus1 wi KHati
            For the bitslice: Bi xored Si BiPlus1 wi Ki
            Generic: plainText userKey cipherText testTitle fnTitle
        I/O FORMAT:
        All I/O is performed using hex numbers of the appropriate size, written
        as sequences of hex digits, most significant digit first (big-endian),
        without any leading or trailing markers such as 0x, &, h or whatever.
        Example: the number ten is "a" in four bits or "000a" in sixteen bits.
        USAGE EXAMPLES:
        serpref -e -k 123456789abcdef  -p 0
            Encrypt the plaintext "all zeros" with the given key.
        serpref -e -b -k 123456789abcdef  -p 0
            Same as above, but the extra -b requests bitslice operation. As
            things are, we won't notice the difference, but see below...
        serpref -e -b -k 123456789abcdef  -p 0 -t Bi
            Same as above, but the "-t Bi" prints out all the intermediate
            results with a tag of Bi, allowing you to see what happens inside
            the rounds. Compare this with the following...
        serpref -e -k 123456789abcdef  -p 0 -t BHati
            Same as above except that we are back to the non-bitslice version
            (there is no -b) and we are printing the items with the BHati tag
            (which is the equivalent of Bi for the non-bitslice version).
        serpref -e -k 123456789abcdef  -p 0 -t xored -t SHati -t BHati
            Same as above but we are requesting even more details, basically
            looking at all the intermediate results of each round as well. (You
            could use the single magic tag -t ALL if you didn't want to have to
            find out the names of the individual tags.)
